# Hangman_Project
Purpose of this project:
------------------------
------------------------

This is an informative project with the solely interest of showing the good practices in Python that I have acquired in order to be a proficient developer.   

Content of the project:
-----------------------

The idea here is to develop the "hangman game" where you have to insert a letter with the objective of guessing a word that comes from a data file. If the letter that you guessed is in the word, it will be shown as many times as it is in the word. If the letter is not in the word, you will be one step closer to lose the game. When the hangman draw is completed before you guessed the word, and therefore all the letters, you will lose the game.
